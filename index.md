I am a Ph.D. candidate at the
[Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University in Brno](https://www.fi.muni.cz/).
The focus of my research is on the analysis and the verification of C/C++ programs.
Presently, I am mostly interested in the efficient representation of program inputs (nondeterministic data) for verification.
I mainly focus on adapting existing techniques like symbolic execution or abstract interpretation to a general framework LART â€“ LLVM Abstraction and Refinement Tool.
This framework leverages program instrumentation and compiler tooling, allowing to design input data representation easily.

Furthermore, I engage in teaching at university, especially in courses on:

- algorithms and data structures
- introduction to programming,
- operating systems,
- and parallel programming.

I actively engage in volunteering activities for high school students and puzzlehunt competitions.
