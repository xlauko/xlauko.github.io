I am a compiler engineer primarily focusing on program analysis and language
theory. I am passionate about unraveling the intricacies of sound and usable
program representation and transformations. Currently, I hold the position of a
senior research engineer at [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), where
I am involved in multiple compiler-related projects (most of the work is open
source, and you can explore these projects in greater detail in the
[Projects](https://xlauko.github.io/pages/projects) section).

I am on the verge of completing my Ph.D. candidacy, awaiting my defense, at the
[Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University in Brno](https://www.fi.muni.cz/).
Throughout my academic journey, I have concentrated on the analysis and
verification of C/C++ programs. My research has been primarily dedicated to
enhancing the efficient representation of program inputs, especially
nondeterministic data, for the purpose of verification. I've focused on the
adaptation of existing techniques, such as symbolic execution and abstract
interpretation, within the general framework [LART](https://github.com/xlauko/lart) â€“ LLVM Abstraction and
Refinement Tool. This framework harnesses the power of program instrumentation
and compiler tools, making it simpler to design effective input data
representations.

Feel free to delve deeper into my research and projects on this page, and don't
hesitate to reach out for collaboration or further discussion.

### Teaching

---

I engage in teaching at university, especially in courses on:

- [PB161](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/jaro2021/PB161?lang=en) C++ programming,
- [IB002](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2020/IB002?lang=en) algorithms and data structures,
- [IB111](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2020/IB111?lang=en) foundations of programming,
- [IB102](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2011/IB102?lang=en) automata and grammars,
- [PB152](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2021/PB152CV?lang=en) operating systems,
- [IV112](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2013/IV112?lang=en) parallel programming.

I am a co-author of exercise books for courses on algorithms and data structures and foundations of programming.

### Volunteering

---

I actively engage in volunteering activities for high school students and puzzlehunt competitions.
As a member of the [Nordic Animals Association](https://zverinec.fi.muni.cz/) (IT student association that organizes events for high school students), I participate in the organization of:

- [KSI](https://ksi.fi.muni.cz/), a yearlong online seminar on computer science for high school students,
- [K-SCUK](https://kscuk.fi.muni.cz/), a weeklong camp for students interested in computer science and/or biology,
- [InterLos](https://interlos.fi.muni.cz/), [InterSob](https://intersob.math.muni.cz/) -- puzzlehunt-like competitions.
