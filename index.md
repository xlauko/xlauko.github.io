I am a compiler engineer specializing in program analysis and language theory,
with a particular focus on MLIR, high-level program representation, and
optimization for C/C++. I am passionate about exploring and refining program
transformations to enhance efficiency and usability. Currently, I serve as a
Senior Research Engineer at [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), where
I lead the compilers team and act as the tech lead for several compiler-related
projects. Many of these projects are open source; you can explore them further
in the [Projects](https://xlauko.github.io/pages/projects) section.

I have completed my Ph.D. at the [Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University in
Brno](https://www.fi.muni.cz/), with my research focusing on the analysis and
verification of C/C++ programs. My work centered on enhancing the efficient
representation of program inputs, particularly nondeterministic data, for
verification purposes. I concentrated on adapting existing techniques such as
symbolic execution and abstract interpretation within the
[LART](https://github.com/xlauko/lart) frameworkâ€”LLVM Abstraction and Refinement
Tool. This framework leverages program instrumentation and compiler tools to
simplify the design of effective input data representations.

Feel free to delve deeper into my research and projects on this page, and don't
hesitate to reach out for collaboration or further discussion.
