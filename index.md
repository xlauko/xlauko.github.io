I am a Ph.D. candidate at the
[Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University in Brno](https://www.fi.muni.cz/).
The focus of my research is on the analysis and the verification of C/C++ programs.
Presently, I am mostly interested in the efficient representation of program inputs (nondeterministic data) for verification.
I mainly focus on adapting existing techniques like symbolic execution or abstract interpretation to a general framework LART â€“ LLVM Abstraction and Refinement Tool.
This framework leverages program instrumentation and compiler tooling, allowing to design input data representation easily.

### Teaching

---

I engage in teaching at university, especially in courses on:

- algorithms and data structures [IB002](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2020/IB002?lang=en),
- foundations of programming [IB111](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2020/IB111?lang=en),
- automata and grammars [IB102](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2011/IB102?lang=en),
- operating systems [PB152CV](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2021/PB152CV?lang=en),
- and parallel programming [IV112](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2013/IV112?lang=en).

I am a co-author of exercise books for courses on algorithms and data structures and foundations of programming.

### Volunteering

---

I actively engage in volunteering activities for high school students and puzzlehunt competitions.
As a member of the [Nordic Animals Association](https://zverinec.fi.muni.cz/) (IT student association that organizes events for high school students), I participate in the organization of:

- [KSI](https://ksi.fi.muni.cz/), an online seminar of computer science
- [K-SCUK](https://kscuk.fi.muni.cz/), a weeklong camp for high school students interested in computer science and/or biology.
- [InterLos](https://interlos.fi.muni.cz/), [InterSob](https://intersob.math.muni.cz/) -- puzzlehunt-like competitions.
